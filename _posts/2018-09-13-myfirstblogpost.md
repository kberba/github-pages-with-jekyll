# My first blog post

Yay, here's my first post! 

I have been trying to learn more about Git/ Github and Front End Web Development using tutorials online (Github, FreeCodeCamp, Udacity). 

It's been an incredibly exciting journey so far. I've always wanted to be able to put my ideas into motion visibly, like in a site. But building a site, as I am now realizing, takes a lot of patience and dedication. 

A lot of small steps that lead into something more. :o

I know this will be worth it if I keep on perservering. I just gotta do it!
